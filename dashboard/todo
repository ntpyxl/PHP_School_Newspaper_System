-   display published articles with just title and date posted, then on click open a modal containing scrollable content. published_articles.php already does this along with edit and delete.

-   same for shared articles but on click should be just new page shared_articles.php

-   writer page just displays writer's published articles and allows for editing and deletion
-   admin page just displays all articles and its status (pending, active), and allows for deletion. should maybe just change status to 'rejected' instead of permanent deletion.
-   should also add 'inactive' status, to signify that it's no longer recent and thus should not be shown in the homepage
